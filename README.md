# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm install  
```

or

```
npm i  
```

This command will directly install the required dependencies into the directory you specify. After this command
completes, you can start the application.

## Run development

```
npm run dev
```

The most important and simple command/program that starts the application compilation procedure from the source code.
For its work, this program uses special configs with all the parameters that we specified with. The result of successful
execution of the make command will be the compiled program in the current directory.

## Create production build

```
npm run build
```

Will creates a `./dist` directory with a production build of your app.
